            <p class="intro-paragraph">Streetwise London shoppers head north from Bond Street station and disappear up a narrow alley off Oxford Street. A signpost points the way to London’s most exclusive shopping experience:</p>
            <h3 class="place-title">ST CHRISTOPHER'S PLACE</h3>
            <p class="full-paragraph no-margin-top">
            Tucked away in pretty cobbled streets of old-world buildings are some of the newest and most directional names in fashion today. They include Mulberry, Whistles, Nicole Farhi and Jigsaw plus Jane and Dada, The Changing Room, Laurence Tang, Body Contact and Europe, which have clothes covering all nuances of style, while Graduate and T. Burrows offer the best in casual menswear. For hair and beauty products are J. F. Lazartigue, Yves Rocher and Toni & Guy Academy. The lively mix of specialty shops and restaurants reflects the diversity and eclecticism of contemporary style and taste: gourmands are offered a choice from Japanese delicacies at Foku and Masako, to traditional Thai, French and Italian. A new Parisian-style brasserie will be opening on Barrett Street this summer. Lucille Lewin, owner of WHISTLES, was an early exponent of independence from selfconscious designer-label branding, and feels a special affection for the street. The recently expanded Whistles flagship store in St Christopher’s Place best exemplifies the look that Lucille wants to achieve: light and a sense of freedom are captured in the relaxed elegance of her designs. The Belgian design team, Anne Kegels and Martine Hillen of ANVERS, chose this location for their first shop in England because “it is a little bit out of the way, which is how we like it.” British design award winner NICOLE FARHI discovered St Christopher’s Place when, as a fashion student, she shopped there. Now firmly established as one of the most influential designers in London.
